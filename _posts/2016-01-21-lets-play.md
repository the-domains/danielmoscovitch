PRODUCTION / MIXING / RECORDING

Having been on the artist's side of the glass for so long, he understands the frustration of ideas getting lot in translation.  He also understands the frustration that can come from paying big money for big names and big studios, only to find that the tradeoff comes in the form of shaky takes making the final cut, and insufficient attention to detail, resulting in an undercooked final product.  Daniel's unique experience recording and mixing in guerrilla fashion, yet attaining world-class results, means that by working with him, you are more likely to have a truly unique sounding record.  Whether you're trying to emulate a specific sound from the past, or try to avoid doing anything that's been done before, you are also getting someone who is a human encyclopedia of recorded music.  With his sense of engineering, musicianship and history, who knows what it is like to be an independent artist in 2016, Daniel is hoping to work with you, to not only realize your creative vision, but to push music forward, exploring boundaries in the process.
