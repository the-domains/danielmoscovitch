Daniel has been playing drums since first grade.  Growing up on classic rock and jazz, he became a musical adventurer, delving deep into all styles of music, eventually developing a deep propensity for Drum&Bass and African rhythm languages.  Twisted through Jazz, Funk and Rock n' Roll, there are elements to Daniel's playing that you'd be hard-pressed to find in most drummers.  Always putting feelings first, it is the effect on the communication of emotion and movement through the drumset that keeps Daniel banging away.

If you're looking for a versatile player who can find the inside line in just about any situation, studio or live, simple get in touch.
